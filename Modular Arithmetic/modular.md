# Modular Arithmetic

* System of arithmetic for integers where numbers wrap around upon reaching a certian value (the modulus)
9 mod 4 = 1 (9 = 2x4 + 1)

## Congruence
* Two integers (**a** and **b**) are said to be *congruent* if they have the same remainder when divided by a specific integer **m**. a = b (mod m). a / m results in same result as b / m
* Congruence is not an operation, it just defines the relationship between a and b.
* **mod m** operation poritions all the natural numbers into m subgroups
  * The **mod 2** operator decides whether a given number is even or odd (so 2 groups)
