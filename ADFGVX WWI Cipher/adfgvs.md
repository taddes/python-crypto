# ADFVGX

The ADFVGS cipher features both substitution and transposition. Encryption begins by drawing a 6 x 6 grid and filling the 36 squares with a random arrangement of letters. Each row and column of the grid is identified by one of the six letters A, D, F, V, G, S. The arrangement of the elements in the grid acts as part of the key, so the recipient needs to know the details of the grid in order to decipher the message
