# Vigenere Cipher
* The Vigenere cryptosystem is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of interwoven Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword.
* *Polyalphabetic Substitution*  that uses several keys.
* The numerical representations of the letters of the secret key define how many characters of the plaintext should be shifted.
* Significantly larger keyspace.  
    * The size of the keyspace is the number of characters in the alphabet (or range) to the power of the length of the key. 
    * Ex. S  E C  R E  T
      18 4 2 17 4 19
      **Assuming 26 Char alphabet: 26^6 = *26,000,000***
* A 16th Century Cipher considered to be unbreakable in its day.
