# One Time Pad - Vernam Cipher
* This cryptosystem uses as many letters in the key as the length of the plaintext. This results in using totally *random numbers* to shift the letters in the plain text.  
* **Key must be of the same length as the plaintext** & **Key must contain random numbers**
* First constructed by Frank Miller in 1882.
