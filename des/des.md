# Data Encryption Standard (DES)

* Met the need for encryption in the commercial sector in the 1970's. Developed at IBM by Horst Feistel.
* Symmetric Block Cipher, where plaintext is processed to ciphertext in blocks. 64-bit chunk of plaintext/binary in a data stream encrypted, resulting in a 56-bit key, which has an 8-bit drop-off.
* Hybrid of a substitution and permutation cipher. **SD Network**
* No longer used because it is crackable with modern methods. Was replaced by Triple-DES
